// PACKET STRUCT AND FREELIST
//
// This module defines a struct to represent packets of network data, and
// implements a global freelist from which packets can be allocated.
//
//   Packet - packet structure with length and data fields
//   PAYLOAD_SIZE - size of packetâ€™s data field
//   init() - initializes the freelist with FREELIST_SIZE packets
//   allocate() -> Box<Packet> - take a packet off the freelist for use
//   free(Box<Packet>) - return a packet to the freelist

// The maximum amount of payload in any given packet.
pub const PAYLOAD_SIZE: usize = 1024*10;

// Packet of network data, with associated metadata.
// XXX - should be #[repr(C, packed)], however that would require unsafe{} to
// access members. Is the memory layout in repr(rust) equivalent?
pub struct Packet {
    pub length: u16, // data payload length
    pub data: [u8; PAYLOAD_SIZE]
}

// A packet may never go out of scope. It is either on the freelist, a link, or
// in active use (in-scope).
// XXX - Could free() packets automatically in Drop, and obsolete manual free.
impl Drop for Packet { fn drop(&mut self) { panic!("Packet leaked"); } }

// Allocate a packet struct on the heap (initialized all-zero).
// NB: Box is how we heap-allocate in Rust.
// XXX - This is a stub. Eventually packets may need to be allocated in DMA
// pages, and follow strict alignment invariants.

    Box::new(Packet { length: 0, data: [0; PAYLOAD_SIZE] })

// Number of packets initially on the freelist.

// thread safety).
// NB: we can cast a mutable reference of the boxed packet (&mut *p) to a raw
// pointer.
// NB: we std::mem::forget the Box p before it exits scope to avoid the heap
// allocated packet from being Dropped (i.e., we intentionally leak
// FREELIST_SIZE packets onto the static FL).

// Return Boxed Packet to FL.
// NB: because p is mutable and Box does not implement the Copy trait free
// effectively consumes the Box. Once a packet is freed it can no longer be
// referenced, and hence can not me mutated once it has been returned to the
// freelist.
// NB: we std::mem::forget the Box p to inhibit Dropping of the packet once it
// is on the freelist. If a packet goes out of scope without being freed, the
// attempt to Drop it will trigger a panic (see Packet). Hence we ensure that
// all allocated packets are eventually freed.
